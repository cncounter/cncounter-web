## Chapter 4. Paths: How to Make Custom Shapes and Curves

## 第4章 Path简介

> 创建自定义图形和曲线。

Circles and squares are great for getting started with Raphael, but eventually you will probably want to branch out into something more complex. For that, we will use paths, a relatively simple set of instructions capable of making almost any shape or drawing you can imagine: squiggly lines, donuts, and figure eights, as well as complex shapes like people or animals.

使用Raphael来绘制圆形(Circles)和矩形(squares)都很容易, 但各种复杂的图形怎么办呢?

这时候，我们就需要用到强大的 `path` 了；path就是路径,是一组相当简单的指令集, 所有你能想到的图形, 都可以用 path 来实现。 比如各种线条、圆圈、数字、人物等等。



To understand how paths work, consider the following standby of those tedious workplace team-building workshops: you and a partner have been placed back-to-back with a matching set of colored pencils. You each have a blank sheet of paper. Your job is to draw a picture and give your partner verbal instructions on how to recreate this picture on his or her own sheet of paper. No peeking.

要理解 path 的工作原理，先来看看下面的这种场景: 

假设你和同事在团建(team-building), 正在进行合作训练游戏, 两个人背靠背(back-to-back), 每人手里有一张白纸,以及一套标准色彩的铅笔。不准偷看, 你的任务就是画一幅画，然后用口头指令, 指挥你的小伙伴重现这幅画。

To make things a little easier, let’s make it graphing paper.

使事情更容易,让它图形。

First, you would be wise to establish with your partner that the upper-leftmost point on the paper has the coordinates (0,0). Then you might go about it something like this:

首先, 你最好是和小伙伴约定好, 白纸最左上角的位置是起始坐标点`(0, 0)`。然后你可能会这样指挥:

1. “Using your pink pencil, start on the point at the coordinates (3,4), and draw a straight line eight units to the right.”
2. “Go down five units.”
3. “From there, draw a diagonal line back to the original point.”
4. “Then, using your green pencil, fill in the space bounded by those lines.”

1. “使用粉红色的铅笔, 从坐标点`(3,4)`开始, 绘制一条直线到右边, 长度为八个单元格。”
2. “向下移动5个单元格。”
3. “从这里开始, 画一条斜线到原点。”
4. “然后, 换成绿色的铅笔, 涂满这几条线之间的区域。”

Assuming you’ve been paired with a halfway competent coworker, you should both now have a green triangle with a pink border. (Hopefully you don’t work for a design company.)

如果没有碰到猪队友, 那现在你们的纸上, 就都画上了一个绿色的三角形, 边框是粉红色的。(这么丑、希望你们公司不是做设计的~~)

For the next shape, you would probably say something like “Start a new shape on the coordinates (15,22)” so that your partner doesn’t accidentally draw a line from the ending point of the last shape to the new one, Etch A Sketch style.

接下来继续绘制其他形状, 比如说“从坐标点`(15,22)`开始,绘制一个新的图形”, 这样小伙伴就不会误解、以为从上个图形的终点继续绘制了。

In case you haven’t guessed, your partner here is a computer. Drawing paths in Raphael is an alchemical process of transforming instructions into shapes. And your partner never messes up, so long as you don’t.

你可能没有想到, 小伙伴转身就变成了一台电脑。在Raphael中绘制path, 就是将指令转换为图形的过程。 只要你不出错，你的小伙伴就不会出错。

## Syntax

## path的语法格式

Paths are represented in browsers as a long string of characters. These strings can be broken down into a series of points that tell the computer where to start, where to end up, and what to do on the way there.

在浏览器中, Path用字符串(String)来表示。 Path字符串可以被分解成一系列的点,告诉计算机从哪里开始, 到哪里结束, 以及中途需要做些什么什么事。

A simple path might look like this:

一个简单的path示例:

```
var d = "M 10,30 L 60,30 L 10,80 L 60,80";
```



This translates to: “Move (M) to the coordinates (10,30), draw a line (L) to the coordinates (60,30), then a line (L) to (10,80), and then a line (L) to (60,80).”

意思是:“移动(M, Move)到坐标点(10,30), 画一条线(L, line)到坐标点(60,30), 然后再画一条线(L)到坐标点(10,80), 再画一条线(L)到坐标点(60,80)。”

To see what a path looks like, initialize a Raphael project by declaring a new `paper` object on a page, and add this line:

看到这个path长什么样, 新建页面, 初始化`paper`对象, 代码如下:

```
var paper = Raphael(0,0,300,300);
var d = "M 10,30 L 60,30 L 10,80 L 60,80";
var mark = paper.path(d);
```



As you see, we made a *Z* pattern starting at (10,30) and ending at (60,80). All we had to do was tell Raphael where to start and define the three points it should visit, tracing a line behind it as it goes.

可以看到, 我们画了一个大大的 **Z** 形图案, 起点为(10,30), 终点为(60,80)。我们需要做的就是告诉Raphael，从哪里来，到哪里去, 要走过哪些路。

You have a little wiggle room when it comes to the precise syntax for paths. The spaces between the letters and the numbers aren’t necessary, since the browser has no difficulty distinguishing when one segment ends and the next begins. The commas between numbers can be replaced with spaces if you prefer. Your syntax will probably condense as you get more experienced.

你有一个小空间的精确的语法时路径.字母和数字之间的空间并不是必要的, 因为浏览器没有困难区分一个段结束时,下一个开始.数字之间的逗号如果你喜欢可以替换为空格。你的语法可能会压缩得到更有经验。

### DRESSING UP YOUR PATHS

### 为path设置颜色

Paths can take many of the same attributes as shapes, including `stroke` (the style governing lines) and fill (governing the space enclosed by those lines). To make a slightly less anemic-looking *Z*, let’s give it a few properties:

path可以设置很多属性、类似于其他图形一样, 比如 `stroke` (线条样式), `fill`(线条内封闭空间的填充)。 想让这个 **Z** 字不那么单调, 可以设置一些属性:

```
mark.attr({
    "stroke": "#F00",
    "stroke-width": 3
});
```



![image-z](04_01_z.png)



See this code [live on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/raphaeljs/RnBMA/).

在线代码演示请参考: <http://jsfiddle.net/raphaeljs/RnBMA/>

If you’re fuzzy on why the browser understands `#F00` as the color red, read up on “hexadecimal color codes.”

如果不熟悉红色的表示方法 `#F00`, 请搜索 “十六进制颜色”。

Just to see what happens, let’s also add some interior color:

试试填充色:

```
mark.attr("fill", "#00C");
```



![z-fill](04_02_z_fill.png)



Hmmm. Since a *Z* is not a “closed” figure, in which the last point rejoins the first, Raphael guesses what to fill in by drawing an imaginary line from the end point to the starting point and then filling in anything that’s bounded on all sides by lines. (This is in stark contrast to the old days of Microsoft Paint, when the fill tool would paint the entire screen if there was even a single pixel missing along the perimeter of your shape.) While the computer is reasonably smart about guessing what to do in these circumstances, it’s much better to just complete your shapes if you want them to have some internal color.

因为 **Z** 不是一个“封闭”的图形, 终点又回到了起点, Raphael画了一条不存在的虚线, 从终点到起点, 然后边界就确定了, 接着在其中进行填充。

(与Windows自带的Microsoft Paint画图工具形成了鲜明的对比, 在画图工具中, 如果填充的不是封闭区域, 则会将整个画布都填充上指定的颜色)。在这些情况下系统会很聪明地猜测用户想要做什么, 如果想要填充内部, 最好形成封闭区域。

To do so, you could just add a final `L10,30` command to the end of the path string, thus drawing a final line that reconnects with the original. The path syntax also offers a convenient command to do the same thing. If you end your path with a `z`, it connects to the beginning automatically. Let’s try it alongside an alternate syntax for the path, just to make sure I was telling the truth above:

可以在path末尾添加 `L10,30` 指令, 绘制一条线到起点坐标。当然,path提供了一种简写的语法, 在最后加上一个字母 `z`, 会自动连接到起始坐标点。 来看看效果:

```
var paper = Raphael(0,0,300,300);
var d = "M10 30L60 30L10 80L60 80z";
var mark = paper.path(d);
```



![z-z](04_03_z_z.png)



### RELATIVE PATHS

### 相对路径

The commands `M` and `L` have younger siblings, `m` and `l`, which function identically except for one key factor: they understand coordinates to be relative to the previous coordinate. We could achieve the exact same *Z* in a more intutive manner like this:

的命令`M`和`L`有弟弟妹妹,`m`和`l`,功能相同,除了一个关键因素:他们理解坐标是相对于前一个坐标。我们可以实现相同的* Z *更intutive方式是这样的:

```
var d = "M10,30l50,0l-50,50l50,0";
```



We started at the same point—using a lowercase `m` here would be meaningless since we don’t have a starting point to be relative to—and then told the computer to move its imaginary pen 50 pixels to the right and zero pixels up, then to the left 50 and down 50, then 50 to the right again.

我们开始在同一时刻使用小写`m`这里将没有意义因为我们没有一个起点相对和然后告诉计算机向右移动它的虚笔50像素和零像素,然后向左50 50,然后再次50到正确的。

For simple cases like this one, it’s often much easier to use relative coordinates. In other cases, you’ll have predetermined points on the screen that you’ll want to connect without doing the math of how far apart they are relative to one another. It’s up to you, and you can mix and match capital and lowercase letters in the same string.

对于简单的这样的情况下,通常是更容易使用相对坐标.在其他情况下,你必须预先确定的点在屏幕上,你要连接不做的数学相对于另一个他们之间的差距有多远.由你决定,你可以混合和匹配的资本和小写字母相同的字符串。

There are two more commands that make life a little easier: `H`, `V`, and their tagalong siblings `h` and `v`, for “horizontal” and “vertical.” These commands only expect one number to follow them, and assume the other is zero. We can simplify our *Z* again like so (I’ve mixed in a capital and lowercase `H` for demonstration):

还有两个命令,让生活简单一点:`H`,`V`和她们的兄弟姐妹`h`和`v`“水平”和“垂直。“这些命令只期望一个数字跟着他们,和其他假设为零。我们可以简化* Z *再次一样(我在资本和小写字母`H`出于演示):

```
var d = "M10,30h50l-50,50H60";
```



## Hopping Around

## 周围跳来跳去

Paths should always begin with an `M`. But if you need to “pick up the pen” during the course of drawing a path to jump to another spot, you can also use the `M` or `m` in the middle of the string. Here’s a capital *I*:

路径应该从一开始`M`。但是如果你需要“捡起钢笔”过程中绘制路径跳转到另一个地方,你还可以使用`M`或`m`中间的字符串。这是一个资本*我*:

```
var I = paper.path("M40,10h30m-15,0v50m-15,0h30");
```



![image with no caption](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/images/raph_04in04.png.jpg)



This is another example where the relative coordinates that come using lowercase letters are very convenient. But just for practice, let’s make the same *I* using only “absolute” coordinates:

这是另一个例子的相对坐标,使用小写字母非常方便。但只是为了练习,让我们犯同样的*我*只使用“绝对”的坐标:

```
var I = paper.path("M40,10H70M55,10V60M40,60H70")
```



Let’s say we want to make some solid shapes, like this irregular triangle, beginning from the lower right vertex:

假设我们想做一些固体形状,这样不规则三角形,从右下顶点开始:

```
var d = "M90,90l-80,-20L50,5L90,90";
var tri = paper.path(d).attr({
    "fill": "yellow",
    "stroke-width": 5
});
```



Since we were careful to make the last point the same as the first, there is no ambiguity as to what should get filled in. Here we have something that looks like a yield sign restructured by a driver who did not, in fact, yield:

因为我们很小心的最后一点和第一个一样,没有歧义,应该填写什么.这里有一些看起来像一个收益率司机没有重组的迹象,事实上,收益率:

![image with no caption](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/images/raph_04in05.png.jpg)



Again, we can freely mix uppercase and lowercase letters in a path string, though doing so may not contribute to one’s sanity during the creation of complex shapes.

再一次,我们可以自由组合大写和小写字母在一个路径字符串,尽管这样做可能不会导致一个人的理智在复杂形状的创建。

Behind the scenes, Raphael stores paths as an array in which each object represents one command of a letter and some numbers. If you were to add the line `console.log(tri)` at the end of the previous example and examine your code in Firebug, you would see something like this:

在幕后,Raphael存储路径作为数组中的每个对象代表一个命令的一封信和一些数字。如果你想添加一行`console.log(tri)`年底在Firebug前面的示例和检查你的代码,你会看到这样的:

```
[Array[3], Array[3], Array[3], Array[3], toString: function]
    0: Array[3]
        0: "M"
        1: 90
        2: 90
        length: 3
1: Array[3]
0: "L"
1: 10
2: 70
length: 3
2: Array[3]
0: "L"
1: 50
2: 5
length: 3
3: Array[3]
0: "L"
1: 90
2: 90
length: 3
```



The careful reader will note that Raphael converted the second point to absolute coordinates when converting the string to the array.

细心的读者会注意到Raphael转换第二点时绝对坐标转换的字符串数组。

It’s useful to understand how Raphael stores paths for the purpose of debugging and getting information about the path after the fact. (Perhaps you want the coordinates of the first and last point in order to draw some objects at either end of a line.) In fact, you can choose to deliver a path command to Raphael in this format as well. You can get the same irregular triangle in the above example using the array form:

是有用的了解Raphael存储路径为目的的调试和事后的路径信息.(也许你想第一个和最后一个点的坐标,以画一些物体两端的一条线.)事实上,您可以选择提供一个路径命令Raphael在这种格式。你可以得到相同的不规则三角形在上面的例子中使用数组形式:

```
var tri = paper.path([["M", 90, 90], ["L", 10, 70], ["L", 50, 5], ["L", 90, 90]]);
```



I personally find it easier and more concise to use the string format and let Raphael deal with converting it to an array, but the choice is yours.

我个人更容易和更简洁使用字符串格式,让Raphael处理将它转换为一个数组,但这是你的选择。

### POLYGONS

### 多边形

Given how common rectangles are in design, it makes sense for Raphael to offer a `.rect()`function, even if it duplicates what can be done with paths with a few more lines. (Actually, this is a decision baked into the SVG specifications, not a shortcut unique to our library.) It would be highly inefficient, on the other hand, for Raphael to offer a `.pentagon()`, `.hexagon()`, and so forth. Fortunately, we now know enough to make any regular polygon we like. Let’s write a function to make a polygon of `N` sides centered around an arbitrary point. It’s going to take a very small amount of trigonometry—three lines, I think—but we’ll get through it together. The function we’re going to write will take the center coordinates (like a circle or ellipse), the number of sides in our regular polygon, and the length of the sides, and return the path as a string.

考虑到常见的矩形设计,提供一个适合Raphael`.rect()`函数,即使重复可以做什么和更多的线。(实际上,这是一个决定烤到SVG规范,而不是一个快捷方式独有我们的图书馆.),那将是非常低效的,另一方面,Raphael提供`.pentagon()`,`.hexagon()`,等等。幸运的是,现在我们知道足以让任何我们喜欢的正多边形。让我们写一个函数的多边形`N`双方围绕一个任意点。需要少量的trigonometry-three线,我预料,但是我们会一起度过.我们要写的函数将中心坐标(如一个圆或椭圆),我们正多边形的边数,两边的长度,作为一个字符串并返回路径。

```
function NGon(x, y, N, side) {
    // draw a dot at the center point for visual reference
    paper.circle(x, y, 3).attr("fill", "black");

    var path = "", n, temp_x, temp_y, angle;

    for (n = 0; n <= N; n += 1) {
        // the angle (in radians) as an nth fraction of the whole circle
        angle = n / N * 2 * Math.PI;

        // The starting x value of the point adjusted by the angle
        temp_x = x + Math.cos(angle) * side;
        // The starting y value of the point adjusted by the angle
        temp_y = y + Math.sin(angle) * side;

        // Start with "M" if it's the first point, otherwise L
        path += (n === 0 ? "M" : "L") + temp_x + "," + temp_y;
    }
    return path;
}
```



Let’s fire this baby up with a few different values and see how we did.

让我们火这个婴儿与几个不同的值,看看我们所做的。

```
var paper = Raphael(0, 0, 500, 500);

paper.path(NGon(40, 40, 6, 30));
paper.path(NGon(130, 60, 9, 40));
paper.path(NGon(240, 160, 25, 80));
```

As you see, a 25-sided polygon is pretty close to a circle, as we might expect. You might even say a circle is a polygon with infinite sides. From there, *RaphaelJS* will leave you to your musings.

如你所见,25-sided多边形是非常接近一个圆,我们可能期望。你甚至可以说一个圆是一个多边形,无限。从那里,* RaphaelJS *会让你去思考。

## Curves

## 曲线

Drawing lines that bend and curve is necessarily more difficult in Raphael because you have more decisions to make. So we’re drawing a curve from point A to point B. Should it curve up or down? By how much? Is it symmetrical?

画线弯曲和Raphael曲线必然是更加困难的,因为你有更多的选择。所以我们从a点到B点绘制一条曲线.应该曲线向上或向下?由多少?它是对称的吗?

The SVG specifications offer a couple of different commands for curves, but the documentation is pretty miserable. In this chapter, we’re going to cover the most intuitive type, the ellipitical curve.

SVG规范为曲线提供几个不同的命令,但文档是很悲惨的。在这一章,我们将覆盖最直观的类型,ellipitical曲线。

### THE `A` COMMAND: ELLIPTICAL CURVES

### 的`A`命令:椭圆曲线

As you might predict, this command creates curves that look like segments taken from an ellipse. As such, they require a few peices of information. Don’t worry if this is confusing at first. It’s naturally confusing, but a few examples will illuminate these parameters.

可以预测,这个命令创建曲线看起来像段取自一个椭圆。因此,他们需要几台信息。不要担心如果这是令人困惑的.自然令人困惑,但几个例子将说明这些参数。

Like lines, elliptical curves begin at the point where the previous command left off.

线条、椭圆曲线开始的前面的命令。

An `A` command looks like this: `C 50,75 0 0,1 400,200.` Those numbers represent:

一个`A`命令是这样的:`C 50,75 0 0,1 400,200.`这些数字代表:

- The horizontal and vertical radii of the imaginary ellipse we’re using as a guide
- An angle rotating the curve’s axis (for advanced users)
- A Boolean value (or “flag”) that is either `0` or `1`, representing whether a curve goes clockwise or counterclockwise
- A Boolean value (or “flag”) representing whether the curve goes the long way or the short way
- The ending point

- 水平和垂直半径的假想椭圆作为指导我们使用
- 一个角度旋转曲线的轴(高级用户)
- 一个布尔值(或“国旗”)`0`或`1`代表一个曲线是否顺时针或逆时针
- 一个布尔值(或“国旗”)代表的曲线是否长期或短期的方式
- 终点

To explore what this means, we’re going to start with a point at `[50, 50]` and end at a point at `[200, 125]`. Let’s draw that and make some dotted lines for reference:

探索这意味着什么,我们要从一个点开始`[50, 50]`和结束点`[200, 125]`。让我们画出来,让一些虚线供参考:

```
var paper = Raphael(0, 0, 500, 4000);
var starting_point = paper.circle(150, 150, 4).attr({ fill: "green", stroke: 0 });
var ending_point = paper.circle(250, 220, 4).attr({ fill: "red", stroke: 0 });

var path1 = paper.path("M 150,150 L 250,150 L 250,220").attr(
"stroke-dasharray", ".");
var path2 = paper.path("M 150,150 v 70 h 100").attr("stroke-dasharray", "-");
```



So far, so good:

到目前为止还好:

![image with no caption](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/images/raph_04in07.png)



Let’s try an elliptical arc with the angle and these two mysterious boolean values set to zero. We’ll use the length and the height of this rectangle as the radii.

让我们试着一个椭圆的弧角和这两个神秘的布尔值设置为0。我们将使用这个矩形的长度和高度的半径。

```
var curve1 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 0 0,0 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "blue"});
```



![image with no caption](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/images/raph_04in08.png)



Nice—we have a beautiful sloping curve connecting the points. Let’s see what happens when we set the first flag to `1` instead of `0`:

可爱我们美丽的倾斜的曲线连接的点。让我们看看会发生什么,当我们设置第一个旗`1`而不是`0`:

```
var curve2 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 0 1,0 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "cyan"});
```



![image with no caption](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/images/raph_04in09.png)



Whoa. The starting and ending points are the same, and we’re still following the path of an ellipse with the same radii, but we went the long way. The SVG specification calls this the “long arc flag,” but I like to call it the “detour value.” If the detour value is zero or false, the curve takes the shorter path to the destination. If it’s one, it takes the longer path.

哇。起点和终点是相同的,我们仍然具有相同半径椭圆路径后,但我们去长的路.SVG规范称之为“长弧国旗,“但我喜欢称之为“绕道价值。“如果绕道值为零或假,曲线较短路径的目的地.如果是,需要更长的路径。

Let’s try the other flag, setting the detour flag back to `0`:

让我们试试其他标志,设置回绕道的旗帜`0`:

```
var curve3 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 0 0,1 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "pink"});
```



![image with no caption](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/images/raph_04in10.png)



This is the same as the first curve, but it takes a clockwise path instead of counterclockwise path. This is officially known as the “sweep flag,” but I like to think of it as the “clockwise flag.” You may notice that curve 3 “completes” curve 2, since its flags have opposite values.

这是第一条曲线一样,但需要一个顺时针路径而不是逆时针路径。这是官方称为“扫国旗,“但我想为“顺时针国旗.“你可能通知,“3”完全curve curve 2,因为其flags有平等相对价值。

Can you guess what our last combination of flags looks like? If you said “a clockwise flag that takes the long way to get to its final destination,” you were correct:

你能猜出我们最后的旗帜的组合看起来像什么?如果你说“一个顺时针的旗帜,把长的路要到达最终目的地,“你是正确的:

```
var curve4 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 0 1,1 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "orange"});
```



Put together, we see that the four combinations describe the two ways an ellipse with an `x`radius of 100 and a `y` radius of 70 can intersect our starting and ending points:

放在一起,我们看到四个组合描述两种方式与一个椭圆`x`100和一个半径`y`半径70可以相交起始和结束点:

See this code [live on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/raphaeljs/T8C8p/).

看到这段代码(住在jsFiddle)(http://jsfiddle.net/raphaeljs/T8C8p/)。

What about that fifth parameter, the angle, that we’ve so far been setting to zero? It’s a common mistake to assume that this is the angle that the curve traverses, but this is not the case. That angle is calculated automatically based on the radii and the end point—no further information is needed. The angle that you set explicitly will rotate the imaginary ellipses. The easiest way to express this is visually. Let’s take the four arcs we just drew and rotate each of them by 45 degrees:

那第五个参数,角度,到目前为止,我们已经被设置为零?这是一个常见的错误假设这个角曲线遍历,但事实并非如此.这个角自动计算基于半径和结束之前没有一个进一步的信息是必要的。您显式地设置的角度将旋转假想椭圆.最简单的方式来表达这是视觉。让我们四个弧我们只是画,它们中的每一个旋转45度:

```
var curve1 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 45 0,0 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "blue"});
var curve2 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 45 1,0 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "cyan"});
var curve3 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 45 0,1 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "pink"});
var curve4 = paper.path("M150,150 A100,70 45 1,1 250,220")
                .attr({"stroke-width": 2, stroke: "orange"});
```

As we can see, we have identically sized ellipses passing through the same points, and then rotated. It’s actually a pretty neat geometric property, but I find it difficult to visualize. That said, I confess that I have never once found the need to rotate my elliptical curves in the wild.

我们可以看到,我们有相同大小的椭圆通过相同的点,然后旋转。这是一个简洁的几何属性,但我发现很难想象.说,我承认我从未发现需要旋转椭圆曲线在野外。

## The `C` Command: Cubic Bézier Curves

## 的`C`命令:三次贝塞尔曲线

The elliptical curve is extremely useful in schematics and other geometric drawings. Most of the curves we observe in art and nature, however, do not neatly fit along the path of an ellipse. In these cases, we make use of the cubic Bézier curve.

椭圆曲线是非常有用的在图表和其他几何图画。大部分的曲线我们观察在艺术和自然,然而,不整齐地沿着一个椭圆的道路.在这些情况下,我们利用三次贝塞尔曲线。

The `C` command takes three pairs of coordinates: the destination and two *control points* that determine how the line bends. In most cases, the curve does not pass through these control points. Instead, we can think of them as invisible magnets that pull the line in their direction as it travels to its destination. This is best illustrated with a few examples in which we will place black dots over the control points for educational purposes.

的`C`命令以三双坐标:目的地和两个* *控制点,确定弯曲。在大多数情况下,曲线不经过这些控制点.相反,我们可以把它们作为无形的磁铁,把线的方向,因为它将前往目的地.这是几个例子最能说明我们将黑点在控制点用于教育目的。

To draw a cubic Bézier curve, one supplies these two control points first and then the destination as the third coordinate. Like all of the other SVG paths, it begins wherever the previous command left off.

画一个三次贝塞尔曲线,一个供应这两个控制点,然后目标作为第三个坐标.像所有其他的SVG路径,它开始在前面的命令。

```
var paper = Raphael(0,0,500,500);

// draw the control points for educational purposes
var cp1 = paper.circle(100, 50, 4).attr("fill", "black");
var cp2 = paper.circle(200, 150, 4).attr("fill", "black");

// draw the bezier curve
var path = "M 50,100 C 100,50 200,150 250,100";
paper.path(path);
```

This path begins at coordinates (50,100) and ends up at (250,100), just like a regular old `L` path. For the first two arguments, I set one control point above the line to the right of the starting point and a second one below and to the left.

这条路开始于坐标(50100)和结束(250100),就像一个普通老了`L`路径。第一两个参数,我上面设置一个控制点线的右边下面的出发点和第二个,左边。

If I move the first contol point to be below the starting point as well, at the same `x`position, the curve assumes a more familiar shape:

如果我移动第一个控制点下面的起点,在相同的`x`曲线的位置,假设一个更熟悉的形状:

```
var paper = Raphael(0,0,500,500);
var cp1 = paper.circle(100, 150, 4).attr("fill", "black");
var cp2 = paper.circle(200, 150, 4).attr("fill", "black");

var path = "M 50,100 C 100,150 200,150 250,100";
paper.path(path);
```

These examples both have some flavor of symmetry, but there’s no reason the points need to reflect one another. Here’s a wackier example:

这些例子都有一些对称的味道,但没有理由的点需要反映。这是一个怪的例子:

```
var paper = Raphael(0,0,500,500);
var path = "M 50,100 C 50,50 300,250 250,100";
var cp1 = paper.circle(50, 50, 4).attr("fill", "black");
var cp2 = paper.circle(300, 250, 4).attr("fill", "black");
paper.path(path);

## Exotic Paths

## 异国情调的路径

The [SVG path specifications](http://bit.ly/path-specs) contain several more advanced commands for Bézier-like curves that reflect back on themselves. I will freely admit that I’ve never once found a use for any of them. Should you wish to dive in, an understanding of control points is all you need to get a sense for how they work. You can see a [lovely interactive example](http://jsfiddle.net/raphaeljs/Mfzn8/) on jsFiddle of one such exotic curve that allows you to manipulate the control points with your mouse.

(SVG路径规范)(http://bit.ly/path-specs)包含一些更高级的命令Bezier-like曲线反映自己.我会坦率地承认,我从来没有发现一个用其中任何一个。如果你想潜水,控制点的理解都是你需要了解它们是如何工作的.你可以看到一个可爱的互动的例子(http://jsfiddle.net/raphaeljs/Mfzn8/)jsFiddle的这样一个奇异的曲线,让您与您的鼠标操作控制点。

## Case Study: Play Ball!

## 案例研究:玩球!

We have a few other types of curves to cover, but I’d like to point out that, halfway through Chapter 4—and that includes the Introduction, where you didn’t even learn anything—we have already accumulated the skills to draw a baseball field.

我们有一些其他类型的曲线,但是我想指出,中途4章,包括引言,你甚至没有学习任何我们已经积累了画一个棒球场的技能。

Looking over Major League Baseball’s [official rules](http://atmlb.com/rules-list), it looks like the minimum allowable distance from home plate to the foul pole is 250 feet. To make our visualization maximally flexible, let’s set that value as a variable, along with one for the scale of the graphic and point of origin for home plate:

窥探Baseball’s联盟少校over http://atmlb.com/rules-list]([官方rules looks like it)allowable距离from the home平坦的最低foul格is to the feet 250.为了使我们的可视化最大限度地灵活,让我们将这个值设置为一个变量,以及一个用于图形的规模和本垒的原点:

```
//pixels per foot
var paper = Raphael(0, 0, 500, 500),
    SCALE = 1,
    HOME_PLATE = { x: 250, y: 350 },
    FOUL_POLE = 250;
```



Of course, SVG graphics are meant to scale without us hard-coding a scaling factor. I find it convenient to define one in the code for situations like this, where there is an explicit scale between the screen and a real world object, whether it’s a stadium or a solar system. We can always scale the whole graphic again down the road if need be.

当然,SVG图形是为了规模没有我们硬编码一个比例因子.我发现它方便代码中定义一个在类似这样的地方,哪里有一个显式的规模之间的屏幕和一个真实世界的对象,无论是球场或太阳系.我们总是可以规模再整个图形如果需要。

You’ll notice I use some uppercase variables. This is a personal convention of mine in JavaScript that I reserve for numerical values that are constant over the lifetime of the program, but that I may wish to alter by hand to change the specs of the graphic. It has no role whatsoever in determining how the program sees the variables. I’ve also stored the `x`and `y` coordinates of home plate in a simple object, rather than taking the time to write `HOME_PLATE_X` and `HOME_PLATE_Y`.

你会注意到我使用一些大写的变量.这是我的一个个人约定在JavaScript中,我保留恒定的数值程序的生命周期,但我希望改变手工改变图形的规格。它已经没有任何作用在决定如何项目将变量。我也存储了`x`和`y`本垒的坐标在一个简单的对象,而不是花时间写`HOME_PLATE_X`和`HOME_PLATE_Y`。

Okay, let’s make a shape that outlines the field. To draw the foul lines, we’ll start at the position of home plate and draw the line 250 pixels to the left field foul pole. This involves a little trigonometry.

好的,让我们做一个形状轮廓。画犯规线,我们将从本垒和画线的位置250像素的左外野犯规.这涉及到一个小三角。

The foul pole is 45 degrees to the left if you’re standing on home plate facing the pitcher. JavaScript’s trig functions need that in radians—that is, π/4.

犯规极是左侧45度,如果你站在本垒面临的投手。JavaScript的三角函数需要在radians-that,π/ 4。

```
var foul_line_left = "M" + HOME_PLATE.x + "," + HOME_PLATE.y + "l"
    + -1 * FOUL_POLE * Math.cos(Math.PI / 4) + ","
    + -1 * FOUL_POLE * Math.sin(Math.PI / 4);
```



Instead of hardcoding the numbers into the paths, as we did in the first examples, it’s generally easier to compute the strings you’ll pass to Raphael by making a string from numerical variables and the required function, as above. If you’re used to “strongly typed” languages like Java or Python, which throw an error when you try to add variables of different types, this will look like trouble. JavaScript is “weakly typed,” so it’s fine with adding numbers to strings, converting them to text in the process.

而不是硬编码的数字到路径,正如我们在第一个示例中所做的一样,通常更容易计算字符串你传递给Raphael通过一个字符串从数值变量和所需的函数,如上所述.如果你习惯“强类型语言,像Java或Python,它抛出一个错误当你试图添加不同类型的变量,这将看起来像麻烦.JavaScript是“弱类型”,所以它很好添加数字字符串,将它们转换为文本。

(Not that we make the `x` and `y` distances after the lowercase “l” negative because we’re going left and up relative to home base.)

(不是我们的`x`和`y`距离后小写字母“l”-因为我们左和相对于基地。)

Now let’s draw an arc along the outfield fence to the other foul pole:

现在让我们画一个弧沿外场栅栏其他犯规杆:

```
    var outfield_fence = "a" + FOUL_POLE + "," + FOUL_POLE + " 0 0,1 "
        + 2 * HOME_PLATE.x * Math.sin(Math.PI / 4) + "," + 0;
```



We’re using the foul pole distance as the radius, meaning home plate will form the center of the circular ellipse describing the fence. We do not want to take the long route, so we set the first flag to `0`, but we do want to go clockwise, so we set the second one to `1`.

我们使用犯规杆的距离为半径,本垒将形成圆形的中心意义描述栅栏的椭圆.我们不想把长的路线,所以我们组第一个国旗`0`顺时针,但是我们想去,所以我们设置第二个`1`。

Last, we’ll draw a line back to where we started, using the capital L for convenience:

最后,我们将会回到我们开始画一条线,使用资本L为了方便:

```
    var foul_line_right = "L" + HOME_PLATE.x + "," + HOME_PLATE.y;

    var field = paper.path(foul_line_left + outfield_fence + foul_line_right)
        .attr({ stroke: "none", fill: "green" });
```



Looking good so far, though the center field fence looks a little close to me. We can remedy this by extending the second radius in the arc:

看上去不错,到目前为止,虽然中心现场围栏看起来有点接近我。我们可以补救这通过扩展第二弧半径:

```
    var outfield_fence = "a" + FOUL_POLE + "," + 1.5 * FOUL_POLE + " 0 0,1 "
        + 2 * HOME_PLATE.x * Math.sin(Math.PI / 4) + "," + 0;

    var field = paper.path(foul_line_left + outfield_fence + foul_line_right)
        .attr({ stroke: "none", fill: "green" });
```



Much better. Now let’s make a square infield representing the basepaths and put some bases on it. To do so, we could make a path that starts at home and then goes 90 feet (pixels) northwest, then northeast, then southeast, then back to home. That would involve a lot of trig. I have a better idea that harkens back to [Chapter 2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/ch02.html): let’s just draw a square and rotate it into position.

好多了。现在让我们做一个正方形代表basepaths田园和放一些基地.为此,我们可以在家里开始的路径,然后是90英尺(像素)西北,东北,东南,然后回到家里。这将涉及大量的三角.我有个更好的主意,回归本源(第二章)(https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/ch02.html):我们先画一个正方形和旋转位置。

First we’ll construct the infield using home plate as an origin and not worrying about rotation. This [handy HTML color table](http://bit.ly/html-colors) suggests that `#993300` is a nice dirt color.

首先我们将构建耕地使用本垒作为起源和不担心旋转。这(方便的HTML颜色表)(http://bit.ly/html-colors)表明`#993300`是一个很好的泥土的颜色。

```
    var infield = paper.set();

    infield.push(paper.rect(HOME_PLATE.x, HOME_PLATE.y, 90, 90)
        .attr({stroke: "none", fill:             "#993300"}));

    infield.attr("transform", "R-135 " + HOME_PLATE.x + " " + HOME_PLATE.y);
```



For the bases, I’m going to make a loop that iterates four times and draws a base on each corner. (Yes, we’re cheating and make home plate a square, but you do have the capacity to draw one using paths for extra credit.)

基地,我要做一个循环迭代的四倍,画了一个基础上每一个角落.(是的,我们作弊,让本垒广场,但你有能力使用路径画一个额外学分)。

```
    //bases
    for (var c = 0; c < 4; c += 1) {
        infield.push(paper.rect(HOME_PLATE.x + 85 * (c % 2), HOME_PLATE.y + 85 * (c >= 2), 5, 5)
            .attr({stroke: "none", "fill": "white"}));
    }
```



Note that `85 * (c / 2 >= 1)` make use of the fact that a true/false statement resolves to zero or one.

请注意,`85 * (c / 2 >= 1)`

To swing the infield into place, we’ll rotate it 135 degrees, using home plate as the pivot point:

摇摆的田园到位,我们会旋转135度,使用本垒作为轴心点:

```
    infield.attr("transform", "R-135 " + HOME_PLATE.x + " " + HOME_PLATE.y);
```

Beautiful! Of course, a real baseball field is much more refined, with dirt extending in a radius from the pitcher’s mound, grass in foul territory, and so forth. I’ll leave it as an exercise to the ambitious reader to extend this example. The point is, there is nothing about a baseball diagram that you cannot replacate with your current Raphael toolset.

漂亮!当然,一个真正的棒球场更雅致,与泥土扩展半径从投手土墩,草在界外,等等.我将把它作为练习留给读者雄心勃勃的扩展这个示例。问题是,没有对棒球图,你不能用你当前replacateRaphael工具集。

## Final Thoughts

## 最终的想法

You might be thinking: Wait, why did I mess around with all that trigonometry if I could have drawn the entire field on its side, with the left-field foul line perfectly horizontal, and then rotated the field 45 degrees, not unlike the strategy for drawing the diamond? To that I respond: Please file all complaints by snail mail.

你可能会想:等等,为什么我浪费时间与所有三角如果我能画的整个领域,垒犯规线完美的水平,然后旋转45度,不像画钻石的策略吗?我回复:请文件所有投诉蜗牛邮件。

Actually, that’s a fantastic idea. In fact, that’s precisely what engineers do all the time, applying a transformation to a dataset that makes it easier to work with. Both ways work, and the best route is always the one that you’re able to best visualize and understand. People who think more conceptually might like to draw the lines in the locations that they will ultimately appear. Those who think geometrically might prefer to draw something on its side, where diagonal lines become straight lines, and then rotate it. Coding is a collaborative process between your mind and the computer’s mind, and happy programmers are ones who find the ideal meeting point.

实际上,这是一个好主意。事实上,这正是工程师做所有的时间,变换应用于一个数据集,使它更容易使用.两方面的工作,最好的路线是总是一个,最好你能想象和理解.人认为更多的概念可能会喜欢画线的位置,他们最终会出现.那些认为几何可能更喜欢画东西,对角线变成直线,然后旋转它.编码是一个协作的过程之间思维和计算机的思维,和快乐的程序员的人找到理想的会议。
